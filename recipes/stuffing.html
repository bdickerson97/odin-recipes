                <li>1 large Yellow Onion - While other onions can be used in a pinch, the yellow variety has a great flavor that sweetens as

                <li>1 tablespoon Herbes de Provence - This is a blend of herbs commonly found in the Provence region in southeastern France.</li>

                <li>Salt & Pepper (to taste) - As always, add as much or a little of these as you'd like!</li>

                <li>17 ounces Stuffing Cubes - Pick your favorite brand of these little bread squares.</li>

                <li>2 cups Chicken Broth - This is another ingredient you can either buy at the store or make from the leftover bones of a
                rotisserie or bird from another recipe.</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven. Set your oven to 350℉ (175℃).</li>

                <li>Melt the butter. Heat ½ cup butter in a large pot over medium heat.</li>

                <li>Then, add veggies and seasoning. Toss 2 ribs of diced celery, 1 large diced yellow onion, and 1 tablespoon minced garlic
                in the butter. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. They should be soft. Add 1 tablespoon herbes de provence along with some salt
                and pepper (to taste). Stir until blended.</li>

                <li>Combine with stuffing cubes. Take the pan off the heat and drop in 17 ounces stuffing cubes. Mix together until the
                butter coats everything.</li>

                <li>Heat the broth. Now it's time to pull out a saucepan and bring 2 cups chicken broth to a low boil. You can also do this
                in a microwave-safe measuring cup in the microwave. Then pour it over the stuffing mix and combine thoroughly.</li>

                <li>Bake. Move the stuffing from the bowl to a greased 9x13” baking dish and cook for 25 to 30 minutes.</li>

                <li>Cool and serve. Remove your stuffing from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</li>
            </ol>
